# zbox

A Leiningen plugin to do resource preprocessing.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[zbox "0.0.1"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
zbox 0.0.1`.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[zbox "0.0.1"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein zbox
